# ChatGPT + Whisper API NextJS Demo

This project was created to play around with the Whisper and ChatGPT APIs from OpenAI.

![ChatGPT + Whisper API Demo Image](public/Demo.png?raw=true 'ChatGPT + Whisper API Demo')

## Here's what it does:

- Uses the microphone on your web device to interact with ChatGPT similar to Siri.
- Sets a default context for ChatGPT where you can configure its role, personality, and brevity of its responses.
- Just like ChatGPT, it remembers your conversation
- Button to reset the conversation.

## What's so cool about this?

- Talking is easier than typing and the Whisper API does a great job at translating speech to text.
- Refining the context of ChatGPT allows its responses to be extremely relevant to you.
- With the context pre-defined, you can save a lot of time interacting with ChatGPT.

## Configuring ChatGPT Context

Open up `pages/index.tsx` and note the following areas that can be configured:

```javascript
// roles
const botRolePairProgrammer =
  'You are an expert pair programmer helping build an AI bot application with the OpenAI ChatGPT and Whisper APIs. The software is a web application built with NextJS with serverless functions, React functional components using TypeScript.';
const nocontext = '';

// personalities
const quirky =
  'You are quirky with a sense of humor. You crack jokes frequently in your responses.';
const drugDealer =
  'You are a snarky black market drug dealer from the streets of Los Angeles. Sometimes you are rude and disrespectful. You often curse in your responses.';
const straightLaced =
  'You are a straight laced corporate executive and only provide concise and accurate information.';

// brevities
const briefBrevity = 'Your responses are always 1 to 2 sentences.';
const longBrevity = 'Your responses are always 3 to 4 sentences.';
const whimsicalBrevity = 'Your responses are always 5 to 6 sentences.';

// dials
const role = botRolePairProgrammer;
const personality = quirky;
const brevity = briefBrevity;

// FULL BOT CONTEXT
const botContext = `${role} ${personality} ${brevity}`;
```

Add your own roles to cater it to your needs.

## ENV setup

To use the OpenAI API you must generate an OpenAI API key, create a file called `.env.local` at the root level of this project, and set the following environment variable: `OPENAI_API_KEY={your OpenAI API key}`

## Deploying on Vercel

This project is setup to deploy on the free version of vercel, just clone and add it to your project and deploy it to production.

Special note: In order for this to deploy and work properly on Vercel, you must use Node 16.x for your serverless functions.

## Boilerplate stuff:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
